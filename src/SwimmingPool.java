//Swimming pool
//
//        Ian was swimming in the pool having size of NÃ—M feets and got tired.
//        At this moment he realized that he is at a distance of X feets from one of the long ledge (not necessarily from the nearest one)
//        and Y feets from one of the short ledges.
//        What is the minimum distance (in feets) Ian needs to swim in order to reach the swimming pool ledge?
//        The program input contains numbers N, M, X, Y.
//
//        Sample Input:
//        23
//        52
//        8
//        43
//        Sample Output:
//        8
